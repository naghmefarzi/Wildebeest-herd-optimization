# Wildebeest-herd-optimization
A global optimization algorithm inspire by wildebeest herding [1]


# Steps
These five following simplified wildebeest behaviors are proposed as the basis of this algorithm:

1.Local movement (Milling behaviour)
2.Herd instinct
3.Starvation avoidance
4.Population pressure
5.Herd social memory

# Experiment
The average performance over 50 independent trials was considered to reduce the effects of lucky or unlucky random initial positions.The mean, median and standard deviation for the 50 independent runs for each test function are reported in the notebook. The performance is compared to other EC algorithms such as "PSO", "GSA", "SA", "GA" and "ABC". Selected benchmarks are "Rastrigin", "Ackley", "Weierstras" and "Sphere".
